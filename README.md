# Magento 2 Send your Invoice Email when Shipment is created

This module shifts the trigger of the transactional invoice email from the invoice creation to the shipment creation. 

Usecase Example:
- You can change the invoice document as many times as you want before the product is sent and your customer receives a legally binding document. 


Advantage:
- Manually sending an invoice to a customer is not affected and still possible.
- No additional email code or templates to maintain required.
- Compatible with PDF-Attachment Extensions.

Works with Magento 2.1.x, 2.2.x
